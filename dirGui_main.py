# Purpose:      For this drill, you will need to write a script that
#               creates a GUI with a button widget and a text widget.
#               Your script will also include a function that when
#               it is called will invoke a dialog modal which will
#               allow users with the ability to select a folder directory
#               from their system. Finally, your script will show the
#               userâ€™s selected directory path into the text field.
#
# Tested OS:  This code was written and tested to work with Windows 10.
